Charlotte is the largest city in the U.S. state of North Carolina, the second largest city in the Southeastern 
United States, just behind Jacksonville, Florida, and the third fastest-growing major city in the United States.

I preferred taking my hometown (Kannur, Kerala, India) to wrangle with. But it seemed too small (less than 50 MB) to 
analyse. So my brother who is settled in Charlotte, North Carolina, suggested me to take this. I would most probably be 
doing my Masters there soon. So he said it’s good to be familiarised with this place.

PS: in order to upload the sample osm file I had to change the code slightly. My osm file is 511 MB. Using the given code
I could shrink to only around 50 MB. Since the requirement was 1-10 MB I had to slightly modify it. I changed it to:

for i, element in enumerate(get_element(OSM_FILE)):
        if i % 50 == 0:
            output.write(ET.tostring(element, encoding='utf-8'))

    output.write('</osm>')
